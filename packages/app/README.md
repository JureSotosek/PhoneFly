# PhoneFly

## Instructions

The local developement experience is not that straight forward since for the game to work, you need access to `FBInstant` that can only be fatched from Facebook like this: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/instant-games/test-publish-share

You also to be logged in as a tester for the game.

```bash
yarn dev # will build the dist files, start the development server and open the link to the game

yarn build # will build the dist files in ./public
```
