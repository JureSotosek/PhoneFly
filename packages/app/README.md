# PhoneFly

## Instructions

The local developement experience is not that straight forward since for the game to work, you need access to `FBInstant` that can only be fatched from Facebook like this: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/instant-games/test-publish-share

You also need to be logged in as a tester for the game to work.

## Development

1. To start the dev server run the dev command: `yarn dev`

2. Visit `https://localhost:3000`, to confirm that you want to proceed with the certificates you have, since they are not signed by anyone.

3. Run the open command `dev:open` or open `https://www.facebook.com/embed/instantgames/746821112354806/player?game_url=https://localhost:3000`.
